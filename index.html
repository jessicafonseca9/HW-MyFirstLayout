    <h3 id="About Me">About</h3>
    <p>My passion for UX began when I studied management during my<br>undergraduate program. Understanding consumer behavior led me to<br>a career in retail management. Achieving excellence in customer<br> service is my number one objective. With that intent, I have dedicated<br>myself to improving the user's experience through UX/UI design.
